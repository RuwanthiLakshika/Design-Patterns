problem related to developer.OS and Phones

when you want to build a phone, according to the phone there are different types of developer.OS.
ex- Apple phone - developer.iOS/ Samsung - developer.Android
there are some people know about the developer.OS, some are not concern about the developer.OS

Problem
You want to build a phone, and based on the phone type, it should have a specific developer.OS.

Apple → developer.iOS (Closed)
Samsung → developer.Android (Open)
Others → developer.Windows (Other)
Some users care about the developer.OS, while others don't.

Solution Using Factory Pattern
Define an abstract developer.OS interface: Represents the common behavior of all developer.OS types.
Create concrete classes: For developer.Android, developer.iOS, and developer.Windows implementing the developer.OS interface.
Implement a Factory class: Decides which developer.OS to create based on the phone type.

Benefits
Encapsulation: The Factory hides the creation logic.
Flexibility: Easily extendable to support more developer.OS types.
Reduced Coupling: The client code doesn't depend on concrete implementations.
