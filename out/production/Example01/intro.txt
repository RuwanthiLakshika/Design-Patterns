In school we have many assignment. To write your assignment you need a pen
So you need the implementation of pen
but i have a implementation of Pilotpen but not the pen
can we use pilotpen in the place of pen?
directly we can't do that, we need a Adapter


Steps to Implement the Adapter Pattern:

Define the Target Interface (Pen):
This is the interface that the client expects.

Use the Adaptee (PilotPen):
This is the existing implementation that doesn't match the target interface.

Create the Adapter Class:
The adapter bridges the gap between Pen and PilotPen.

Client Code:
The client uses the Pen interface, unaware of the PilotPen behind the scenes.
