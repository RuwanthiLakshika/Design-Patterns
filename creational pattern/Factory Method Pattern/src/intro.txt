 Introduction:
 The Factory Method Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but
allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

 Purpose:
 Define an interface for creating an object, but let the classes that implement the interface decide which
class to instantiate. The Factory Method defers the instantiation to subclasses.

Key Features:

 Abstraction:
 ● Centralizes object creation in a single function, separating the process of constructing a class
from its use.
 Flexibility:
 ● Subclasses can redefine which class to instantiate, allowing for a variety of objects to be
created.
 Modularity:
 ● Object creation code remains isolated from the rest of the system, promoting a modular
design.
