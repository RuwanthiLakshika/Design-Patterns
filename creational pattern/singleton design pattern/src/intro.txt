 Introduction - The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global
point to access it. It's often used where system-wide actions need to be coordinated from a single central
place.

 Purpose
 ● Control object creation to ensure only one instance of a given class exists.
 ● Provide a global point of reference to that instance
